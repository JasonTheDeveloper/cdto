Finder Toolbar app to open the current directory in the Terminal (or [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com), [Hyper](https://hyper.is), X11)

 * It's written in objective-c, and uses the scripting bridge so it's *fast*.
 * It's also shell agnostic. Works equally well when your shell is `bash` or `fish` or `tcsh`.
